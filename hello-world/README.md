This is a true "Hello World!" FPGA example.

Here we use a UART to send the string "Hello World!" at 115200 baud over the
ULX3S' FTDI chip. Simply connect via you favourite serial program and press the
left-most button on the board (the first "FIRE" button, see constraints file).
Then you should repeatedly see the string "Hello World!" being printed on the
terminal.
