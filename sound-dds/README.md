This is an example for doing direct digital synthesis in verilog.

Three waveforms are supported: sine, sawtooth and triangular. The frequency may
be set using another signal.

An sample implementation for the ulx3s is included. Pressing buttons will allow
for selecting between the modes and three frequencies.
